# Testing the New PlayerCore Architecture

## ✅ **Setup Complete!**

The multi-platform PlayerCore architecture has been successfully integrated into your application.

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### Option 1: Test with Real Content (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to the app**: `http://localhost:5176/`
2. **Sign in** with your credentials
3. **Browse content** and select any movie or TV show
4. **Click Play** - The new PlayerPageNew will now be used automatically
5. **Observe the new features**:
   - Platform detection (Web/Android/iOS/Electron)
   - Automatic highest quality selection
   - Audio track enumeration
   - Subtitle track management
   - Source details display

### Option 2: Test with Demo Page

A dedicated test page has been created at `src/pages/PlayerTestPage.tsx` that:
- Uses a public domain test stream (Big Buck Bunny)
- Shows platform detection
- Displays all available tracks (audio/subtitles/qualities)
- Provides a real-time event log
- Demonstrates the unified API

**To access it**, you can:
1. Temporarily modify the HomePage to add a test button, OR
2. Use the browser console to navigate: `window.location.hash = 'player-test'`

### Option 3: Browser Console Testing

Open the browser console and test the PlayerCore directly:

```javascript
// Import the PlayerCore
import { createPlayer, detectPlatform } from './player/core/PlayerCore';

// Create a player instance
const platform = detectPlatform();
const player = createPlayer(platform, {
  preferHighestOnStart: true,
  autoPlay: false
});

// Load a test stream
await player.load({
  url: 'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8',
  type: 'hls',
  provider: 'Test Stream'
});

// Get available tracks
const qualities = await player.listQualities();
const audioTracks = await player.listAudio();
const textTracks = await player.listText();

console.log('Qualities:', qualities);
console.log('Audio:', audioTracks);
console.log('Subtitles:', textTracks);

// Set to highest quality
await player.setQualityMax();

// Play
await player.play();
```

## 🎯 **What to Test**

### 1. Platform Detection
- **Web**: Should use Shaka Player or hls.js
- **Android**: Would use ExoPlayer (requires React Native)
- **iOS**: Would use AVPlayer (requires React Native)
- **Electron**: Would use mpv (requires Electron setup)

### 2. Quality Management
- ✅ Auto-selects highest quality on start
- ✅ Lists all available qualities
- ✅ Allows manual quality selection
- ✅ Displays current quality in UI

### 3. Audio Track Management
- ✅ Lists all embedded audio tracks
- ✅ Shows language and channel count
- ✅ Allows track switching
- ✅ Auto-selects preferred language

### 4. Subtitle Management
- ✅ Lists all embedded subtitles
- ✅ Shows language and format
- ✅ Allows track switching
- ✅ Supports external subtitle attachment
- ✅ VTT overlay with safe-area positioning
- ✅ ASS rendering for anime (when libass-wasm is added)

### 5. Playback Controls
- ✅ Play/Pause
- ✅ Seek
- ✅ Volume control
- ✅ Mute/Unmute
- ✅ Progress tracking

### 6. Event System
- ✅ Ready event
- ✅ Time updates
- ✅ State changes
- ✅ Track changes
- ✅ Quality changes
- ✅ Error handling

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### On Web Platform:
1. **Shaka Player** loads automatically
2. **Highest quality** is selected (e.g., 2160p, 1080p)
3. **Audio tracks** are enumerated from the stream
4. **Subtitles** are listed and can be toggled
5. **Playback** starts smoothly with hardware acceleration

### Console Output:
```
[PlayerCore] Platform detected: web
[PlayerCore] Player created successfully
[PlayerCore] Test stream loaded
[PlayerCore] Player ready
[PlayerCore] Tracks loaded: 2 audio, 3 text, 5 qualities
```

## 🔍 **Debugging**

### Check Browser Console:
- Look for `[PlayerCore]` logs
- Check for Shaka Player initialization
- Verify track enumeration
- Monitor event emissions

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "Shaka Player not available"
- **Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure shaka-player is installed

**Issue**: "No tracks found"
- **Solution**: The stream might not have multiple tracks; try a different source

**Issue**: "Subtitles not showing"
- **Solution**: Check that a subtitle track is selected in the UI

**Issue**: "Quality not changing"
- **Solution**: Verify the stream has multiple quality levels

## 📝 **Architecture Overview**

```
